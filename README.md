# LINQtoSQLITE-using-dbMetal

Hi all,

This a basic how to get started with dbMetal to achieve LINQtoSQLite functioality.

I've already made the .dbml and .cs files using dbMetal, If you would like a detaled how to on that please do write to me.

In this project, I've included a sample database file, Custom.db with a few tables and dummy data. I query the dummy data and perform Inserts, just the basics to get anyone interested in using dbMetal started.

Hope you find it useful,
Cheers!

PS: dbMetal can be found here: https://github.com/DbLinq/dblinq2007
    sqlite.dll file I used can downloaded here: https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki
    Or you can just add the sqlite.core nuGet package to your project, and use the dll that provides in dbMeta to ensure it works properly.
